# first_API
This repository contains notes, lessons, and hands-on projects I completed while taking a Coursera course on APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). The course provided both theoretical and practical understanding of how APIs work, how to consume them, and how to design and implement them effectively.
What I Learned

## API Fundamentals:
Understanding what APIs are, how they enable communication between software systems, and common types such as REST and GraphQL.

HTTP Basics: Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), status codes, headers, and request/response structures.

RESTful API Design: Best practices for creating scalable and maintainable APIs.

Authentication & Authorization: Using API keys, OAuth, and tokens for secure access.

JSON & Data Exchange: Working with JSON data formats for API requests and responses.

API Testing Tools: Hands-on experience with Postman and cURL for testing endpoints.

Building APIs: Developing and deploying simple RESTful APIs using Python (Flask) / Node.js (Express).

## Hands-on Practice

This repository includes:

Example API requests/responses

Postman collections for testing different endpoints

Mini projects that demonstrate how to build and consume APIs

Code snippets showing integration with external APIs (e.g., weather data, GitHub API, etc.)

## Skills Gained

REST API development and consumption

Working with JSON data

HTTP request handling

Secure authentication methods

API documentation and testing
